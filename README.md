# E-commerce-Data-Engineering-Pipeline

Tech Stack: Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Python, PySpark, MySQL, REST API

1.Designed and implemented end‑to‑end Medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) in Azure Data Factory, automating ingestion of 8+ CSV tables from GitHub and Filess.io into ADLS Gen2.

2.Developed parameterized ADF pipelines with ForEach loops and Lookup activities, reducing manual tasks by 80% and supporting dynamic ingestion of new datasets.

3.Built Azure Databricks notebooks using PySpark to perform data cleansing, enrichment, and aggregation; loaded transformed data into Delta Lake for downstream analytics.

4.Configured secure service‑to‑service connections (Service Principal + Managed Identity) between Databricks and ADLS Gen2, ensuring enterprise‑grade access control.

5.Collaborated with cross‑functional teams to validate data quality and establish cost‑optimized storage tiers (Hot, Cool, Archive), achieving a 30% reduction in storage costs.
